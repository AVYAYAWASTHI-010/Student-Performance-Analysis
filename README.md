# üìä Student Performance Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of student academic performance using a dataset containing demographic, socioeconomic, and academic information. The goal is to uncover insights that can help educators and policymakers support students more effectively.

## üìÅ Dataset Used
The dataset used in this project contains over 30,000 records with the following key columns:
- Gender  
- Ethnic Group  
- Parent Education Level  
- Parent Marital Status  
- Lunch Type  
- Test Preparation Status  
- Practice Sport  
- Is First Child  
- Number of Siblings  
- Transport Means  
- Weekly Study Hours  
- Math Score  
- Reading Score  
- Writing Score  

## üß† Analyses Performed
The following analyses were conducted using Python (Jupyter Notebook):

### 1. Gender Distribution
- **Insight**: Gender distribution is roughly balanced.

### 2. Impact of Parents' Education on Student Scores
- **Insight**: Higher parental education correlates with higher student scores in all subjects.

### 3. Impact of Parents' Marital Status on Scores
- **Insight**: Students from married families tend to perform slightly better.

### 4. Distribution of Ethnic Group
- **Insight**: Ethnic Group C is the most common. Some performance differences exist across groups.

### 5. Test Preparation vs Performance
- **Conclusion**: Students who completed test preparation scored higher in all subjects. Preparation has a positive effect.

### 6. Weekly Study Hours vs Performance
- **Conclusion**: More study hours generally lead to better academic performance. A clear upward trend is seen.

### 7. Sports Activity vs Performance
- **Conclusion**: Students who regularly or sometimes play sports perform better, suggesting physical activity supports learning.

### 8. First Child vs Performance
- **Conclusion**: First-born children slightly outperform others, possibly due to more parental attention.

### 9. Transport Means vs Performance
- **Conclusion**: Students who walk or use private transport score marginally better, possibly due to shorter commute times.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## üìå How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment.  
2. Load the dataset (`Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv`).  
3. Run the analysis cells.  
4. Review the visualizations and conclusions.  

## üìé Outcome
This analysis helps identify factors that impact student performance, providing valuable insights for intervention strategies.
